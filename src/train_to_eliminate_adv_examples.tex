  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item So far, we have only talked about solving the \red{inner maximization} to create adversarial examples

    \vspace{10pt}
    \item \textbf{Question}: What do we need to solve to train adversarially robust networks?
    \vspace{3pt}
    \item \textbf{Answer}: Solve the \green{outer minimization}

    \vspace{10pt}
    \item \textbf{Question}: What algorithm can use to solve the outer maximization?
    \vspace{3pt}
    \item \textbf{Answer}: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the adversarial examples
      \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \setlength{\itemsep}{4pt}
        \item \textit{Intuition}: SGD on adv.\ examples' loss reduces the \red{inner maximization}
        \item \textit{Takeaway}: Given an algorithm that transforms training examples into adv.\ examples (e.g.,~PGD), the rest of the \textbf{\blue{training process proceeds normally}}
      \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Why Should You Believe the Preceding Claims are True?}
  \onslide<+->{}
  \onslide<+->{\textbf{Answer}: You shouldn't.  The preceding explanation is definitely \red{not a proof}.}

  \vspace{20pt}
  \onslide<+->{\madry\ rely on \textbf{\blue{Danskin's Theorem}} that states gradients at inner maximizers (think adversarial examples) correspond to descent directions for the complete problem}

  \vspace{20pt}
  \onslide<+->{\textbf{Problem}: Multiple assumptions made by Danskin's Theorem's \red{do not apply} here, e.g.,~continuously differentiable function, only \red{\textit{approximate}} inner maximizers etc.}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \setlength{\itemsep}{6pt}
    \item Empirical results show that despite Danskin's not holding, \madry's approach is robust
    \item A more complete discussion of how Danksin's applies to this problem is in Appendix~A (see Arxiv version) and is beyond the scope of this talk
  \end{itemize}
